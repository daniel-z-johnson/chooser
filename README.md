## Chooser
A Simple web app that is almost like a coin or roll of the
dice to help decide between n things. You can add an item or items
multiply times if you want to introduce bias for a certain item or items

Some goals of this self exercise are
1. Show some, if only a tiny amount, understanding of Spring Boot
2. Make something I want to use, got this idea when I had to choose between 4 items
3. Eventually add a GUI, probably AngularJs or ReactJs haven't decided
